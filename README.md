# ðŸ’¾ My dotfiles

This directory contains all my dotfiles. (Spoiler alert: they will always be a work in progress...)

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed on your system

### Git

```
brew install git
```

### Stow

```
brew install stow
```

## Installation

First, check out the dotfiles repo in your `$HOME` directory using git

```
$ git clone git@github.com/restartdk/dotfiles.git
$ cd dotfiles
```

then use GNU stow to create symlinks

```
$ stow .
```

## Final Step

Enjoy using my dotfiles! I will try to update this somewhat when I stop my addiction to adding plugins
